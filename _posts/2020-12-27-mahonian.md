### Problem [**Inversions**][problem-link]

Find the number of permutations of $$ {1,2,...,N} $$ with exactly $$ K $$ [inversions] (modulus $$2$$).

<br/>

### Summary of my approach
#### Step 1
Figure it is called *"mahonian triangle numbers"*, either by using [OEIS] or by reading at the bottom of this wikipedia page [inversions].

#### Step 2
Find the relationship with *"Truncated Euler Product Triangle"* from this [paper][paper].

You can basically write mahonian numbers as: $$ M(r, c) = \sum_{k=0}^{c} {r+c-k \choose r} P(r, k) $$

#### Step 3
Realize that if $$ c < r $$ then $$ P(r, k) $$ becomes only a function of $$ k $$ (Every row is a prefix of the next row!). The paper also points out that: $$ P(r, c) = p(c) $$ for $$ c < r + 2 $$.

#### Step 4

Since we want the answer modulus 2, $$ {N \choose K} \bmod 2 $$ can be done in $$O(1)$$. Read [my other post]({% post_url 2020-10-23-combination_parity %}) to see how.

#### Step 5
Finally, if you generate `p(c)` for c up to 100, you realize that it is very sparse!

{% highlight c %}
1 -1 -1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
{% endhighlight %}

Doing some research, it turns out the non-zero indices are a series called *Generalized Pentagonal Numbers* and there is an efficient way to generate them one by one. Using [Pentagonal Number Theorem][pent-theorem], you can generate the non-zero indices. The k-th index $$ G_k $$ is calculated as: 
$$ G_{k} = \frac{k(3k − 1)}{2} $$ for k = 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, -3, ...

<br/>

### Code and Time Complexity

There are $$ \sqrt{N} $$ non-zero terms and for each term we do $$ O(1) $$ calculation. So the total time complexity is $$ O(\sqrt{N}) $$.

Here is [the code][my-code] I submitted during the contest and below is a cleaned up version of it.

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

ll comb2(ll n, ll p) {
    return (p & (n - p)) ? 0 : 1;
}

ll g(ll n) {
    return (3 * n * n - n) / 2;
}

ll calc(ll r, ll c, ll n, ll num) {
    return (2 + comb2(r + c - n, r) * (num % 2 == 0 ? 1 : -1) ) % 2;
}

ll mahonian(ll r, ll c) {
    ll res = calc(r, c, 0, 0);
    for (ll num = 1; ; num++) {
        for (ll mul: {1, -1}) {
            ll nxt = g(num * mul);
            if (nxt >= c + 1) return res;
            res = (res + calc(r, c, nxt, num)) % 2;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    ll tc, n, k;
    cin >> tc;
    while (tc--) {
        cin >> n >> k;
        cout << mahonian(n-1, k) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
