### Motivation

Let's take a look at [Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)][dft] and how it can be used to solve numerous problems in programming competitions with few lines of code. First let's understand what DFT is and how to calculate it efficiently.

### Polynomials

A polynomial of degree $$n-1$$ can represented in three different ways:
1. Coefficients: $$\, <a_0, a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_{n-1}>$$
2. Samples: $$\, A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} $$
3. Roots: $$\, A(x) = c (x-r_0) (x-r_1) \cdots (x-r_{n-1}) $$


### Operations on Polynomials

Typically we would like to do three operations on these polynomials:
1. Evaluation
2. Addition
3. Multiplication

<br/>
#### Evaluation
Given $$ A(x) $$ and a $$ x_0 $$, we want to calculate $$ A(x_0) $$. You can use [Horner's Method][horner] (shown below) to evaluate the polynomial in $$ O(n) $$ time.

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A(x) & = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} \\
     & = a_0 + x (a_1 + x (a_2 + \cdots + x(a_{n-1}) \cdots ))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

<br/>
#### Addition
Given $$ A(x) $$ and $$ B(x) $$, we want to calculate $$ A(x) + B(x) $$ for every $$ x $$ and it can be done simply by adding the corresponding coefficients: $$ c_k = a_k + b_k $$.


<br/>
#### Multiplication
In order to multiply $$ A(x) \times B(x) $$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A(x) \times B(x) & = (a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}) \, (b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + \cdots + b_{n-1} x^{n-1}) \\
     & = a_0 b_0 + (a_1 b_0 + a_0 b_1) \, x + (a_0 b_2 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_0) \, x^2 + \cdots
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

In short, the coefficient $$ c_k $$ is calculated as: $$ c_k = \sum_{j=0}^{k} a_j b_{k-j} $$

It is clear that doing so would take $$ O(k) $$ time for calculating each coefficient and in total the algorithm will run in $$ O(n^2) $$. Here, we want to learn how to do this operation in $$ O(nlogn) $$.
